Some of the Project Euler problems I solved in C#

**Remember to try and work on all problems yourself first before looking at solutions.** Though I sure know how frustrating the difficult problems can be :)

Currently includes only part of my solutions, I'll complete it over time. I'll probably also keep this repository updated when I solve further problems in the future. Notably, this contains the utility library I wrote over time to deal with repeated issues like prime generation, pandigitalness checks, etc.
